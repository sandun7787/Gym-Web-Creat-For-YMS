            <p className='h'>Eegah (1962) is an American horror film by Arch Hall. Cast: Arch Hall Jr., Marilyn Manning, Richard Kiel, Arch Hall Sr. Poor Eegah. He’d never seen a girl until one fell into his arms. But what’s a prehistoric giant to do when his primitive passions are turned on? Richard Kiel, best known as the villainous ‘Jaws’ from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, stars as the oversized caveman, while Arch Hall Jr. (Wild Guitar) is the singing, swinging hero. Originally made for the drive-in market, this curiosity is featured prominently in ‘The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made,’ by Golden Raspberry founder John Wilson.
